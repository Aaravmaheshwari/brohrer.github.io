          When we're getting started on a project or in the field, the mountain of tools to choose from can be overwhelming. Sometimes it makes me feel small and bewildered, like Alice in Wonderland. Luckily, the Cheshire Cat cut to the heart of the problem:
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">
          “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
          <br>
          “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
          <br>
          “I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
          <br>
          “Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
          <br>
          “–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
          <br>
          “Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”
          <br>
          (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Chapter 6)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          If you don't have a goal in mind, then it doesn't matter which tool you use.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Choose a goal</h3>
        <p>
          The Cat recasts our problem. Instead of choosing a tool, we need to first choose a goal. It should be specific and concrete. When your goal is clear, you should be able to answer most of these questions:
          <ul>
            <li>What do you want to build?</li>
            <li>What question will it answer?</li>
            <li>How will it look?</li>
            <li>Who will see it or use it?</li>
            <li>What is most important to them?</li>
          </ul>
          Even if your purpose is as broad as "learn data science," structure your training as a set of small, well-defined projects. The best way to learn a skill is to use it to
          <a href="http://brohrer.github.io/one_step_program_become_data_scientist.html">create things</a>. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Consider trade-offs</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-algorithm-choice/">
          As with machine learning algorithms</a>, no tool is inherently better than any other. Each is suited to different circumstances.
          One may be faster, but the other has a simpler interface. One may be more flexible, but the other is easier to learn. Here's where the work you did choosing a specific goal really pays off. It will tell you what is most important. The trade-off between performance and ease of use is a common one. Fast and opaque or slow and intuitive? If your goal is to perform a set of calculations for a monthly report, speed may be less important than explainability of the approach and maintainability of the code. But if your goal is to do real-time algorithmic trading on the New York Stock Exchange, then extra speed will be well worth any amount of impenetrable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't yet know what the strengths and weaknesses of your options are, that's a fine place to invest some research time. Search the Internet. Read the ranting emails from your co-worker about the pain being inflicted on them by the latest version of the library they're considering. Chat with your hacker friends. Don't implicitly trust any one source. Collect a small data set and look for themes. 
        </p>

        <h3>Traps to avoid</h3>
        <p>
          You can't have everything. Choosing will require giving up some things you want for others you want more.
