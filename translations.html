          If you are one of the generous readers who has volunteered to translate or adapt Data Science and Robots blog posts, I am deeply grateful to you. If you are considering it, I encourage you to jump right in. You can help us reach a diverse group of people and build your own professional skills in the process. Here are some pointers and answers to common questions to get you started.
        </p>
        <h4>Where do I start?</h4>
        <p>
          Pick a post, choose what you want to do with it and do it. No need to get my approval. 
        </p>
        <h4>How do I handle attribution and licenses?</h4>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise noted, everything on the blog is released under the extremely permissive <a href="">Creative Commons 0</a> license, so technically you don't have to. (However, I don't recommend that path. It can do irreparable damage to your professional reputation.) I recommend this approach:
          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li><b>Claim authorship.</b> Whether you are translating a post, coding up the examples or transcribing a video, you are using your knowledge and creativity, and you deserve the credit for that. If anyone asks me, I'll vouch for the fact that you are the author.</li>
            <li><b>Link to the original.</b> Mention the original source material and leave a link for the interested reader. </li>
            <li><b>Add a license.</b> Be clear about what you expect from those who want to share and use your work. Even if you mean to impose no restrictions, do that explicitly, and call out a permissive license, like Creative Commons 0. </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
