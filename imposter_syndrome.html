        <h4>I am not a real data scientist.</h4>
        <p>
        I don’t have a degree in computer science or statistics. My degree is in mechanical engineering, of all things.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’ve never used Spark.
        </p>

        <p>
        I've never used a deep learning framework, like TensorFlow or Keras.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’ve never touched a GPU.
        </p>

        <p>
        I don't know R.
        </p>

        <p>
        But I haven’t given up hope. After reading through a dozen data scientist job postings, I estimate that I can become a “real” data scientist if I can get just five PhD's and 87 years of job experience.
        </p>

        <p>
        This might sound familiar. Imposter syndrome is feeling like everyone else in your field is more qualified than you are, that you will never get hired or, if you already have been, that you are a mistake of the hiring process. Based on my conversations with colleagues, I estimate at 9 out of 10 of us suffer from imposter at some time. (If this sounds entirely unfamiliar to you, I recommend an introspective reading of “<a href=”http://psych.colorado.edu/~vanboven/teaching/p7536_heurbias/p7536_readings/kruger_dunning.pdf”>Unskilled and unaware of it</a>” by Kruger and Dunning.)

        <p>An ewok. I promise.</p>

        <h4>What a real data scientist looks like</h4>

        <p>
        “Data science” is a term that has generated a lot of excitement and, like a magnet, has pulled in lots of nearby subfields. In my experience, the master-of-all-trades data science unicorn is a mythical beast. The field we call data science is still relatively young, yet already too broad for an individual to be an expert in every corner of it. So how are we to proceed?
        </p>

        <p>
        There are two paths forward: generalist and specialist. 
        </p>

        <p>
        A good <em>generalist</em>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>is superficially familiar with every part of data science</li>
          <li>recognizes all the jargon and technical terms</li>
          <li>has a good notion of what tools and expertise are needed to solve a given problem</li>
          <li>asks insightful questions in technical reviews</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        A generalist do not necessarily know the details of how an algorithm works and the gotchas of a tool.
        </p>

        <p>
        A good <em>specialist</em>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>understands one area deeply</li>
          <li>can explain their area of expertise to non-experts</li>
          <li>understands the tradeoffs between different approaches</li>
          <li>is up to date on current research and new tools</li>
          <li>can use their tools quickly to produce high-quality results</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        A specialist may not know much about something outside their area.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another word for generalist is “broad” and for specialist is “deep”. We are all part generalist and part specialist. As you evolve through your career, you get to find the mixture that works best for you.
        </p>

        <p>
        Note that both generalists and specialists have lots of things they don’t know. This means that even real data scientists will spend a good fraction of their days feeling lost and confused. This is OK. The goal of your training isn’t to accumulate answers, it’s to ask better questions.
        </p>

        <h4>How to prove that you are a real data scientist</h4>
        <p>
        Traditionally, advanced degrees are how we establish our qualification in a field. Unfortunately for most of us, there are few such degrees available in data science. We have no piece of paper to use as a shield when someone questions our qualifications. So what do we do instead? How can we answer our critics, or interviewers, our colleagues, and harshest of all, the voices in our head?
        </p>

        <p>
        Consider woodworking. Imagine that you want to install a custom cabinet in your kitchen. Three carpenters show up inquiring after the job. The first one presents you with a certificate. She says, “I apprenticed with the premier cabinet maker in the city for seven years.” The second opens her toolbox and says, “My chisels are of the latest design, and no one has a sharper plane.” The third hands you a small box, cherry-colored and perfectly smooth. When you pull the handle with a fingertip, a drawer slides out soundlessly. She says, “I made this.”
        </p>

        <p>
        Certifications, tools and portfolio are all popular ways for establishing credentials. I won’t argue that one is superior than another, but portfolios are particularly effective for data scientists. Certifications are few and not yet standardized. Listing algorithms and computer languages we have used doesn’t convey our depth of familiarity with them or what we can do with them. <a href=”https://brohrer.github.io/one_step_program_become_data_scientist.html”>Building things</a> shows to a non-technical audience what we can do for them, and demonstrates our expertise for technical interviewers and colleagues. Of course, this doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get a job on your first interview, but that’s normal. <a href=”https://brohrer.github.io/get_data_science_job.html”>Keep interviewing.</a>
        </p>

        <h4>How to tell whether a candidate is a real data scientist</h4>

        <p>
        “Data science” is a slippery notion, like “love” or “intelligence”. It has generated a lot of excitement, which is great, but also a lot of ambiguity, which is not.  It means something different to everyone, and a word that means too many things is in danger of meaning nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
        The solution to this ambiguity is to <a href=”https://brohrer.github.io/stop_chasing_unicorns.html”>be specific about what skills and experience you are looking for</a>. Asking for research experience in deep neural networks or a background in financial data visualization will draw applicants that fit your needs. And focusing on what candidates have created will build your confidence that they are indeed real data scientists.
