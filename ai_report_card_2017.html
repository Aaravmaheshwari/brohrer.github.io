          140 character summary: <strong>AI is still dumb, but sometimes it can be helpful.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This year has been surreal in a lot of ways, but my favorite is this: non-ironic conversations In the cultural mainstream about super intelligent AI subjugating humanity. 
          Experts and pundits were split. Some pooh-poohed the possibility and some raised the alarm.
          Opinions on the topic are widely varied and strongly held, but wherever you fall, it bears asking the question, Just how smart is AI today?  If the machines were to rise right now, would we have a chance?
        </p>

          If it were a contest of multiplication, the answer would be no. When I was in the third grade, my intelligence was measured how long it took me to do a hundred multiplication problems and how many I got right. But even the earliest computers were much better at multiplication than any human. In fact, a 2017 laptop can do multiplication problems faster than all the humans in the world combined. On the other hand, if it came down to the ability to assemble Swedish furniture based on pictorial instructions, humans would definitely come out on top, particularly if there were a few missing parts.

          The fact that machines are better at something than humans is not new. However 2017 has added a few notable victories to the machines’ tally.

        <h3>Machine IQ</h3>

          So just how close are machines to becoming smarter than humans? The most common measure of human intelligence is the intelligence quotient or IQ. To determine your IQ, you are subjected to a series of tests, measuring different aspects of your cognitive function. When you are done, you are compared to a large group of other people who have taken the same tests. If your scores are average, you get an IQ score of 100. If you do better than average, your IQ is higher, and if you do worse than average it’s lower.

          We can abuse this notion a little to create a Machine IQ. If machine does something as well as a human, then it would have a Machine IQ of 100. If it does something twice as well as a human, we would give it a Machine IQ of 2 x 100 = 200, and if it only does 1/10th as well as a human, it would earn a Machine IQ of 1/10 x 100 = 10. So, based only on the Swedish furniture test, we might conclude that Machine IQ  tops out at 0.001. However, if we base it on multiplication, Machine IQ is 1 trillion.

          To get a well-rounded estimate of machine I Q It is necessary to consider a eyes capability across a range of tasks. here’s the method I recommend. But the glass of your favorite drink in a comfortable quiet corner, think through your activities over the last year. Which of them could in ARI perform today, without requiring any new technological advances. How quickly could it learn compared to you? How quickly could you do the task? How good would it be? Better than you? By how much? After completing wide ranging, non-rigorous survey of activities, I concluded that on balance hey I can do about 3% of what I do, or do most of what I do about 3% as well. That’s a Machine IQ of 3.

          If that seems low to you, consider a few fact that are easy to forget, in our excitement about AI’s achievements:

          Today, AI systems are one-trick ponies. The systems that play Go and the systems that drive cars are different in almost every way. They may share a few algorithms, but the implementation of those is customized to each use case to the point where no detail is the same. It is easy to imaging AI as a monolithic thing, like HAL 9000 or Ultron, but in practice it is more like a box of tools. My hammer, my screwdriver and my crescent wrench are all much better at what they do than my fingers are, but none of them can do all the things my fingers can do. Artificial intelligence is not a single thing, but loose connection collection of very specialized solutions to very specific problems. Algorithms that can out-do humans when categorizing a collection of images can also become useless when the task is changed slightly, for example, by changing the value of a single pixel https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08864

          2. AI systems require a lot of care and feeding. Even the most sophisticated algorithms require a whole retinue of fixers and tweakers to keep them at top performance. Whenever anything changes in their own makeup or the world around them ( which happens incessantly) it might break them. They do not adapt to arbitrary changes we do. For every minute a machine learning model spends spitting out impressive results, human data cleaners and ground truth labelers spent an hour carefully preparing the data to spoon feed it. The algorithms are hilariously inept without constant watchful care. [Link to failure]


          3. Cherry picking. Results don’t include all the failures along the way and all the tasks that produced no satisfying results at all. Recent successes are high points, they are a handful of tasks for which machines have shown an aptitude. However, of all the tasks that machine learning researchers have tried to solve using, these are the few in which they’ve been successful. For every headline making algorithm, there are 1000 I didn’t do anything notable. The successes we know have been cherry picked through survivor bias. They don’t represent the broad swath of machine learning attempts. 

          For all of our inefficiencies and irrationality (or perhaps thanks to them) humans excel at adaptation. Our facility in adapting is so great that we are unconsciously competent, handling a torrent of minor deviations and surprises each waking moment. As a species we may resist big changes, but when we rise to them, we can adapt to nearly anything. This includes the loss of a limb, our vision, and half a cerebral cortex. Jobs least likely to be done by a machine are the ones that require the most variety and the most  adaptation. Machines are approaching the point where they can perform almost any single skill better than a human, but they can’t touch a human when comes to variety, and they’re not even in the same league when it comes to adaptation.

          <h3>Force multiplier level</h3>

          The tremendous asymmetry in human and machine performance shows what we knew all along: humans and machines are good at different things. Yes, my phone is better at multiplication than I am, but I don’t actually spend much time doing multiplication. In fact, whenever I need to calculate a tip on a bar tab, I make my phone do my multiplication for me. My phone does what it’s better at, so that I can do what I’m better at--nodding a goodbye to the bartender as I leave and anticipating how my driver is going to misinterpret the address I entered.

          Viewed from this direction, it also makes sense to ask another question: How much smarter are we with AI than without? How much more can I do, thanks to algorithms? We can put a number of this with a separate measure, which we’ll call a Force Multiplier Level. If AI doesn’t help us achieve anything more than we could do on our own, it multiplies our output by 100%--no change. If it doubles our output, that would be a force multiplier of 200%. And if it hinders us such that we can only achieve half as much, we would assign it a force multiplier of 50% .

          Driving in traffic image

          20 years ago I moved to Boston. Navigating its one way streets and creatively striped intersections took more driving skill than I had. A battered paper map in the passenger seat was not enough to get me directly to my destination. Now, thanks to specialized route planning algorithms, my phone talks me through every step of my journey. My travel time and blood pressure are cut down by half. Based on driving navigation, the AI force multiplier level is 200.

          AutoCorrect. It allows me to furiously and sloppily tap my phone and makes pretty good guesses about what I meant to type. However it does require proofreading in order to in void embarrassing mistakes, and two on correct all the instances of the word ducking.

          Social media. Image.

          When connecting with friends online through social media, clever algorithms suggest people that I may know, we’re people in my vicinity of that I might like to connect with. These recommendations remind me of people that I have met, but I’ve forgotten about. Occasionally I’ll reach out, and end up setting up a professional contact or making a friend. On the other hand, these same platforms also have clever algorithms that show me ads. And videos. Unfortunately these can occasionally be relevant and interesting and I catching. And so much so, that they distract me from my original task of reaching out. The end result of this, is that I may have been just as effective at connecting with people had I stuck with a handwritten note or telephone call. When this happens, I would give this a force multiplier level of 100.

          To get an overall Force Multiplier Level score, I repeated the introspection exercise, Looking back on 2017 and asking the question how much did AI help me to accomplish what I did? After careful and scientific reflection, I concluded that AI makes us 20% more effective, giving it a Force Multiplier Level of 120.

          In summary, AI still has a very long way to go before it is smarter than humans, but it is quite useful as a partner:
          A Hammer does not need to be very smart to greatly improve our ability to drive nails. AI is not yet a serious contender as a competitive intelligence but is becoming valuable as a cooperative one.
