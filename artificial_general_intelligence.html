          140 character summary: <strong>An AI that can do one thing better than a human is old news. AIs that can do multiple things well are the new frontier.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>AI is cool</h3>
        AI is dominated by custom solutions.
        <p>
          Machines have achieved some impressive feats lately. They drive more safely than people do. They beat the worlds best players at Go. Most AI systems are built to work with one type of data, like pictures or sound. And most of those are customized to solve one particular problem. And most of those are optimized to do well on a single data set.


        </p>

        <h3>AGI is the new AI</h3>
        <p>
AIs that can do several (or many!) things well is way cooler.          Adaptation. Variation. Start to compete with humans.
        </p>

We are at the leading edge of the AGI trend. In 2018 a lot of other companies, big and small, will jump on the bandwagon and. There will be a lot of noise and it will be tough to tell the substance from the fluff. Here’s what to watch for: demonstrated results from a single system on set of very different tasks.Brilliant theories of intelligence are a dime a dozen. Super human performance on a single task, however cool, is not a G.I. Look for the players, academic and corporate, who can show their ID is in action.  And especially watch for any who are willing to share their code. That is the ultimate sign of confidence.
        
        <h3>AIs that can do many things is hard. </h3> 
        <p>
          Solutions are built in by human engineers. Humans are part of the system.
          Doing multiple tasks is exponentially cooler and exponentially harder.
        </p>
        <h3>Everyone is doing it.</h3> 
        <p>
          Actually it’s the old AI too.
          Many of the household names in AI and machine learning are aligned with one of these efforts. AGI is mainstream again.

        <h3>Becoming the best at one thing is not the way to become good at many things.</h3>
        <p>
Philosophers, educators, and college admissions officers have been debating it for years, but in this context smart usually means “smart compared to a human.“

The next question is what test should we use to score a machines intelligence? And this introduces another choice: specific or general. Do use the analogy of athletics, specific test of athleticism might be a single event, such as the hundred meter dash or the dead lift. And the specific test such as this, whoever can run 100 m the fastest is the weather. Period.

Specific tests have the benefit of being easy to understand. They are also straightforward to train for. The goal is narrow and well-defined.

The downside of specific tasks, whether of athletics or intelligence, is that they inevitably emphasize just a few aspects of a complex phenomenon. Depending on the test you choose, the results will be very different. Michael Jordan is one of the best basketball players ever, but he was unimpressive at baseball. There is even a lever pressing task in which rats routinely beat humans. 

One way to get around this is to create general test by combining a bunch of specific tests. Or athletic ability, great example of this is the decathlon. Deep mind Atari. CommAI . OpenAI Gym. 





Metaphor: screw driver versus hands
Calculator versus brain

Metaphor: sprinter versus decathlete
Specific versus general


Milestones for general intelligence

Intelligence: achieving a goal well, completing a task well
General : 
Which algorithm is best?
No algorithm is best,
There is no free lunch
Even rats are better than humans at some things.
It doesn't make sense to ask which algorithm is best. Only which is best for a given task or set of tasks.
Decathlon

Task sets:

DeepMind (atari)

Bad for 2 + 3 or anything else
