          140 character summary: <strong>An AI that can do one thing better than a human is old news. AIs that can do multiple things well are the new frontier.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
          AI is cool. Machines have achieved some impressive feats lately. They drive more safely than people do. They find skin cancer in cell phone photos. They beat the worlds best players at Go by a wide margin. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, AI is dominated by custom solutions. Most AI systems are built to work with one type of data, like pictures or sound. And most of those are customized to solve one particular problem. And most of those are optimized to do well on a single data set.
        </p>

        <h3>AGI is the new AI</h3>
        <p>
          Actually AGI is the old AI too. The early champions of AI envisioned machines that had a wide variety of human capabilities. That proved to be way harder than expected, and so research efforts focused on narrower problems that could show measurable progress within the span of a single research grant. 
          
          Still, an AI that can do lots of different things is way cooler. A drone that can

            identify an endangered black rhinoceros</a>
          is awesome, but a drone that could also tag poachers with tracking devices, then gently herd the rhinos away from them - that would be mind-blowing. The potential impact from systems that can solve several hard problems, and adapt to unexpected circumstances is huge.
        </p>
        <p>
          There has always been a group of researchers dedicated to the harder goal of making an artificial intelligence that is comparable to humans in breadth and adaptability. In the last few decades, this line of research has been given little money, and the attention it drew has been disdainful more often than laudatory. But now, at the simultaneous cresting of waves of entreprenurial interest, computing power and academic popularity, AGI is the next new thing. Many of the household names in AI and machine learning are working toward it in some way. AGI is mainstream again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, building an AI that can do many things is hard. For the most part, AI today is a cooperative effort between engineers and computers. Domain experts build in as much knowledge as they can, giving the algorithms a running start on a long runway. Humans are part of the system. This doesn't scale well to systems that are intended to adapt on the fly and solve several unrelated problems. In AGI systems, the humans will have to take a step back and rely on the algorithms to handle everything, if for no other reason, because humans won't know exactly what tricks and insights to program into the machine beforehand.

        <h3>Everyone is doing it</h3> 
        <p>
          Research teams from most of the big tech companies and many other small ones are contributing to the effort to build AGI.

          We are at the leading edge of the AGI trend. In 2018 a lot of other companies, big and small, will jump on the bandwagon and. There will be a lot of noise and it will be tough to tell the substance from the fluff. Here’s what to watch for: demonstrated results from a single system on set of very different tasks.Brilliant theories of intelligence are a dime a dozen. Super human performance on a single task, however cool, is not a G.I. Look for the players, academic and corporate, who can show their ID is in action.  And especially watch for any who are willing to share their code. That is the ultimate sign of confidence.

        <h3>Becoming the best at one thing is not the way to become good at many things.</h3>
        <p>
Philosophers, educators, and college admissions officers have been debating it for years, but in this context smart usually means “smart compared to a human.“

The next question is what test should we use to score a machines intelligence? And this introduces another choice: specific or general. Do use the analogy of athletics, specific test of athleticism might be a single event, such as the hundred meter dash or the dead lift. And the specific test such as this, whoever can run 100 m the fastest is the weather. Period.

Specific tests have the benefit of being easy to understand. They are also straightforward to train for. The goal is narrow and well-defined.

The downside of specific tasks, whether of athletics or intelligence, is that they inevitably emphasize just a few aspects of a complex phenomenon. Depending on the test you choose, the results will be very different. Michael Jordan is one of the best basketball players ever, but he was unimpressive at baseball. There is even a lever pressing task in which rats routinely beat humans. 

One way to get around this is to create general test by combining a bunch of specific tests. Or athletic ability, great example of this is the decathlon. Deep mind Atari. CommAI . OpenAI Gym. 





Metaphor: screw driver versus hands
Calculator versus brain

Metaphor: sprinter versus decathlete
Specific versus general


Milestones for general intelligence

Intelligence: achieving a goal well, completing a task well
General : 
Which algorithm is best?
No algorithm is best,
There is no free lunch
Even rats are better than humans at some things.
It doesn't make sense to ask which algorithm is best. Only which is best for a given task or set of tasks.
Decathlon
